## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Obtain the credit card approval dataset for analysis. The dataset should include information about various attributes such as income, age, employment status, and credit history, along with the approval status.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies or outliers. Perform necessary data transformations and feature engineering.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and explore relationships between different attributes. Visualize the data using appropriate graphs and charts.

4. Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that strongly influence credit card approval decisions. Apply feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis, chi-square test, or recursive feature elimination.

5. Model Building: Develop a predictive model to predict credit card approval outcomes. Use suitable machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests. Train the model on a portion of the dataset and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.

6. Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters or trying different algorithms to improve its performance.

7. Documentation: Document the analysis process, key findings, and insights obtained from the data. Explain the methodology, assumptions made, and limitations of the analysis.
